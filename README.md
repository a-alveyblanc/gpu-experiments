# CUDA experiments

Collection of CUDA experiements, kernel optimizations, and tensor framework
ideas I've generated while doing my PhD.

What this is:
- One-off experiments, learning exercises, etc. of GPU architecture and kernel
  optimizations

What this is not:
- A fully polished, entirely correct set of GPU kernels
- A set of highly optimized, cuBLAS equivalent kernels 

There might be notes in some of the directories which are effectively me
"thinking out loud". While I try to keep them tidy, information in them might be
(1) outdated, (2) incorrect. Some of the notes are *really* old and from when I
first started writing CUDA code.

**In progress**: As of 9/30/2025, I'm in the process of moving linux distros,
and I will be adding more stuff to this repo as I finish up that process. As
such, the repo is a bit sparse for now but will fill out.
